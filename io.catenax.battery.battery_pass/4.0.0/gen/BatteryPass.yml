    BatteryPass:
      description: |-
        The battery pass describes information collected during the lifecycle of a battery. The battery passport is heavily based on the Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2023 concerning batteries and waste batteries, amending Directive 2008/98/EC and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 and repealing Directive 2006/66/EC.
        Additionally attributes come from the Proposal for Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation.
